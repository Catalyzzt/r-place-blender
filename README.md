# r/Place Blender/Python Visualization

r/place visualized using Python and Blender.

## How?

1. Find an r/place timelapse video and convert each frame into a .png image.
2. Create a function that converts the image into RGB values into two grids:
   - Pixel color
   - Pixel age
3. Create a grid in blender and set the color of each pixel according to the color in the grid.
4. Set the height of each pixel according to the age of each pixel in the grid.
5. Profit!
